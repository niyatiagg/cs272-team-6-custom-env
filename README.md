## Custom Environment - CAR CRASH
## Authors: Niyati Aggarwal, Rajshri Ganesh Iyer and Lillian Zhang

## Overview
Our custom environment simulates a car crash scenario. It is based on the highway environment. We added a 2-car crash halfway down the road and modified the reward function to encourage safer driving. You can experience the environment in manual control mode by running ```python run_custom_env.py```.
