## Overview
Our custom environment simulates a Car Accident scenario built on top of [Highway-Env](https://highway-env.farama.org/environments/highway/) and [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/). We added a 2-car crash halfway down the road and modified the reward function to encourage safer driving. You can experience the environment in manual control mode by running ```python run_custom_env.py```.
