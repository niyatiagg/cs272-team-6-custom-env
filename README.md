## Custom Environment - CAR ACCIDENT (accident-v0)
## Authors: Niyati Aggarwal, Rajshri Ganesh Iyer and Lillian Zhang

## Overview
Our custom environment simulates a Car Accident scenario built on top of the Highway and Gymnasium environments. We added a 2-car crash halfway down the road and modified the reward function to encourage safer driving. You can experience the environment in manual control mode by running python run_custom_env.py.
